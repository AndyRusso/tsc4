# My solutions for TSC4
This repository contains my solutions to all 5 tasks. All tasks are fully written in FunC, except additional one-line asm functions.

This is the first time I've completed all 5 tasks on this contest in the 3 times I participated, so I'm very glad to share my solutions. I hope someone can find this helpful!

Task 3 and 4 are commented as much as possible to explain everything that happens there.

Task 1, 2, 5 do not have a lot of comments because there is not much to additionally explain anything.

Comments were added after the challenge ended, however the actual code has not been modified - this is my last submission resulting in the total `27.999` score on the [leaderboard](https://standings.tonsmartchallenge4.com). (hence why there're some quirks here and there)
